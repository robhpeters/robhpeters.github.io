				<p>Hi - my name is Rob Peters and welcome to my website! I grew up with a small family in Lancaster County, PA.
				My sister, three years my senior, joined the marching
				band her freshmen year and I followed in her footsteps three years later. From then on my weekends were filled with
				football games, band competitions, and friendships that have endured for 25+ years. Every summer I would
				spend two weeks, which at the time felt like a lifetime, at the Jersey Shore. The sun-soaked and carefree
				days spent on the beaches with evenings spent exploring the boardwalk in Wildwood and Ocean City.
				</p>
				<p>Having grown up in a mostly sheltered small town, when it came time to select a college to attend I thought I
				might try to expand my horizons by picking a school in a larger city. However, when I visited Dickinson College, nestled in
				Carlisle, PA, I was immediately at ease on its tree lined and limestone walled campus and felt like I was at home.
				When I entered college I really had no idea what I wanted to do with my life or even what I wanted to major in.
				During my freshman year I had an excellent Calculus Professor who inspired me to want to pursue Mathematics. It
				was a subject area that was well suited for me and helped hone my analytical skills that would prove
				invaluable in my career in the software implementation industry.
				</p>
				<!-- Career background sub-section of biography page with link to company website-->
				<p>Similar to the position I found myself in four years previously, I really wasn't sure what direction
				I wanted to move in once I finished college. This resulted in my staying close to home and taking a job
				that had no relation to my schooling, but I was excited to have my first real job. It wasn't long before
				I realized that it wasn't the direction I wanted to go in life but it did expose me to my first real
				software applications. I was intrigued by how they worked and decided that it was an area that I was
				interested in pursuing in more detail.
				</p>
				<p>I decided to pursue this track and was able to land my first job with a technology firm testing and
				installing software on mainframe systems. Unfortunately, this job wasn't as exciting as I had hoped,
				and it was short lived due to the nature of it being a government contract. However, I was able
				to make an internal transfer within the company as a data analyst in the pension outsourcing industry. I
				didn't have any particular affinity to pensions or the way that they worked, but I was enthralled with
		    	learning about the system and its underlying technology. It was my first experience with a database and
		    	I loved learning everything I could about system analysis, design, SQL, and many other aspects. Fifteen
		    	years later I am still working in the same industry and have become a respected Senior Implementation
		    	Consultant at <b><a href="http://www.lifeworks.com" target="_blank">LifeWorks</a></b> (opens in a new window).

				<!-- Personal info sub-section of biography page links to Recipes and Travel sections -->
				<p>After starting to work from home full time in 2010 I have moved around a few times and ultimately
				made my home in Fort Lauderdale, FL. I enjoy not having to deal with snow and being near the beach reminds
				me of those summers I used to spend by the ocean in New Jersey. Outside of work two of my biggest passions
				are travel and cooking. I encourage you to check out my <b><a href="travel.html">travel</a></b> page which
				includes some photos of the various places I have had the pleasure to visit. Additionally, my
				<b><a href="cooking.html">recipes</a></b> page has some of my favorite meals that I have cooked for friends
				over the last few years. Both pages will be updated with additional content as time permits.
