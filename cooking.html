			<ul class="recipe-ingredient">
				<li>8 medium bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (2.25 pounds)</li>
				<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
				<li>Good olive oil</li>
				<li>2 cups halved thinly sliced yellow onions (2 onions)</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons dry white wine</li>
				<li>8 ounces creme fraiche</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon good Dijon mustard</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
			</ul>
			<article class="recipe-steps">
			<p>Place the chicken thighs on a cutting board, skin side up, and pat them dry with paper towels.
			Sprinkle the chicken with 1.5 teaspoons of salt and .75 teaspoon of pepper. Turn them over and
			sprinkle them with one more teaspoon of salt.</p>
			<p>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large (11 to 12-inch) cast iron skillet over medium heat.
			When the oil is hot, place the chicken in the pan in one layer, skin side down. Cook over medium
			heat for 15 minutes without moving, until the skin is golden brown. Turn the chicken pieces with
			tongs, add the onions to the pan, including under the chicken, and cook over medium heat for 15
			minutes, stirring the onions occasionally, until the thighs are cooked to 155 to 160 degrees and
			the onions are browned. Transfer the chicken (not the onions) to a plate and allow to rest uncovered
			while you make the sauce. If the onions aren't browned, cook them for another minute. </p>
			<p>Add the wine, creme fraiche, Dijon mustard, whole-grain mustard, and 1 teaspoon of salt to the
			skillet and stir over medium heat for one minute. Return the chicken, skin side up, and the juices
			to the skillet, sprinkle with parsley, and serve hot.</p>

			</figure>
			<ul class="recipe-ingredient">
				<li>2 tablespoons good olive oil, plus extra to cook the pasta</li>
				<li>1 pound lean ground sirloin</li>
				<li>4 teaspoons minced garlic (4 cloves)</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
				<li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
				<li>1.25 cups dry red win, divided</li>
				<li>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
				<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
				<li>3/4 pound dried pasta, such as orecchiette or small shells</li>
				<li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
				<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
				<li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
				<li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			</ul>
			<article class="recipe-steps">
			<p>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. Add
			the ground sirloin and cook, crumbling the meat with a wooden spoon, for 5 to 7 minutes,
			until the meat has lost its pink color and has started to brown. Stir in the garlic, oregano,
			and red pepper flakes and cook for 1 more minute. Pour 1 cup of the wine into the skillet and
			stir to scrape up any browned bits. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon salt, and
			1.5 teaspoons pepper, stirring until combined. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil, add a tablespoon of salt, a splash of oil,
			and the pasta, and cook according to the directions on the box. While the pasta cooks, finish the
			sauce. Add the nutmeg, basil, cream, and the remaining 1/4 cup of wine to the sauce and simmer
			for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until thickened. When the pasta is cooked, drain
			and pour into a large serving bowl. Add the sauce and 1/2 cup of Parmesan and toss well.
			Serve hot with Parmesan on the side.</p>

			<ul class="recipe-ingredient">
				<li>2 teaspoons (1 packet) unflavored gelatin</li>
				<li>3 cups heavy cream, divided</li>
				<li>2 cups plain whole mile yogurt</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
				<li>Seeds scraped from 1 vanilla bean</li>

				<li>2 tablespoons Grand Marnier liquer</li>
				<li>Fresh Raspberry Sauce</li>
				<li>2 (6-ounce) packages fresh raspberries</li>
			</ul>
			<article class="recipe-steps">
			<p>In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin on 3 tablespoons cold water. Stir and set aside for 10
			minutes to allow the gelatin to dissolve. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together 1.5 cups of
			the cream, the yogurt, vanilla extract, and vanilla seeds. Heat the remaining 1.5 cups of cream
			and the sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat just until the sugar
			dissolves. Off the heat, stir the softened gelatin into the hot cream and stir until dissolved.
			Pour the hot crema and gelatin mixture into the cream and yogurt mixture and stir in the Grand
			Marnier. Pour into 7 or 8 serving glasses and refrigerate uncovered until cold. When the panna
			cottas are thoroughly chilled, cover them with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Before
			serving, spoon 2 tablespoons of the fresh raspberry sauce on each panna cotta and top with
			fresh raspberries. Serve cold.</p>
