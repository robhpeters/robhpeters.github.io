        <h3 class="resume-heading">ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>Over the 15 years I have worked in the DB Outsourcing industry, I have always
          enjoyed a challenge and jumped at opportunities to learn new technologies and skills.
          I have enjoyed wearing different hats over the years from System Support Analyst,
          Testing, and Data Analyst honing my expertise and developing into leadership roles
          in both Data and Calculation implementations. I am interested in taking my existing
          skillset and applying and expanding it in an HCM consulting role where I get
          to work with diverse teams of people to grow personally and professionally while
          leveraging these teams to achieve challenging goals together.</p>
